# Bus Load Allocation
Service to allocation zone-level power loads to bus-level demand

This service is designed to provide a web-hosted [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) gui application that can be used to allocate zone-level power demand loads to individual busses over a 24 hour period.

## Development

The service can be run locally by creating a virtual python environment, installing the packages specified in `requirements.txt` and then running the command `streamlit run app.py`
